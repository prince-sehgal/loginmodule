I am very disappointed with your behaviour this time and seriously want to close my both accounts (saving + current). I tell you reason behind this – I have been falsely charged for services which was actually not disclosed by branch or Relationship manager at the time when I opened my account. People in your bank pushes customer to get features un necessarily, just because to justify their own target. No one disclose any kind of charges applicable on services. I got my first account in kotak as salary account. Your RM explained me benefits of having this account initially and I was happily using these features. Now, when I converted my salary account to saving account no one has informed me about these limits and charges accepting AQB limit which was 10k instead of 50K.  Even though No one has given me any kind of joining kit for Edge account. You can not charge for withdrawing my own money and taking bank statement like this. I want my complete money back and also want to close both of my account thanks.

I have taken bank statement for one time and charged for three times. It’s a fault in your system and at the same time I will not pay for this, you have to reimburse this amount.

 

very first day when I got my salary account in Kotak that I was initially informed about facilities/ features of that account type by one of your relationship manager. He given me complete kit including ATM card, Cheque book and some printouts mentioning all terms and conditions. I happily used services as per need every time. Two years back I switched to another company and got my salary account in ICICI. I tried to close my kotak bank account but again your RM pushed me to keep it as it has much better services. Only explanation I got from him side that was he has converted my account to Edge Type – where instead of keeping 0K as AQB I would be keeping 10K as AQB. Now, on 12 of February, 2018 I have been charged for two transactions one is cash with drawl and second for taking statement. Which is totally un accepted, if there was charges for these services, why that guy (who taken my req. in branch) has not informed me before taking request. I mean how could you charge for withdrawing my own money from account. I have accounts with other banks as well. We can take one bank statement in a year without any charges.
