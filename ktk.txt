GRO,

I raised my concern to your customer support. They ensured me that they will arrange a callback from branch and closed my request SR# 9307299201. Till date, I have not received any call regarding this. This is the reason why I am writing this to you.


I want to bring behavior of Kotak into your notice. How exactly they are convincing customers to switch/ opt any service just for their own target.

I am very disappointed with your services this time and seriously want to close my both (Saving + Current) accounts. I tell you reason behind this – I have been falsely charged for services which was actually not disclosed by branch or Relationship manager at the request time. People in your bank pushes customer to get features un necessarily, just because to justify their own target. No one disclose any kind of charges applicable on services. Very first day I started with Kotak by opting salary account type. Your RM explained me benefits of having this account initially and I was happily using these features. Now, when I converted my salary account to saving account no one has informed me about these limits and charges accepting AQB limit which was 10k instead of 50K.  Even though, No one has given me any kind of joining kit or any document mentioning all terms and conditions for this account type. 

In December 2017, I made two transactions –

1.	Cash with draw at branch of Rs. 4 Lakh.
2.	Bank statement taken for prior year.

I have been charged for above both transactions, without intimation. Here is the breakup of charges debited from my account on 11th and 12th of February, 2018.

12/02/2018  Chrg: Cash Withdrawal 11122017 ROHTAK  	        TBMS  -826. 00    

11/02/2018 Chrg: AdhocStamt 01-APR-17 to 06-DEC-17 CPSP TBMS -118. 00 
  
11/02/2018 Chrg: AdhocStamt 01-APR-17 to 06-DEC-17 CPSP TBMS -118. 00 
  
11/02/2018 Chrg: AdhocStamt 01-APR-17 to 06-DEC-17 CPSP TBMS -118. 00 


As per record, you have charged 3 times for taking statement. I have taken statement only for 1 time.

Whatever the reasons are, Its none of my business. If you charge for a particular service then you should inform customer on very first day. You cannot take customer conmise for any kind of facility without disclosing all terms. I want my complete money back and also want to close both of my account.

For your further reference here is my saving account CRN – 74199270

Thanks,
